### Hi there 👋

My name is **Cihat Gündüz** (Cihat read like "**Jeehut**"), I'm an **📱Indie iOS Developer** from 🇩🇪Germany.

I'm doing iOS development **since 2011** and because I've learned so much from the great developer community in my first years, I'm trying to now give something back by **contributing 🔨Open Source tools & frameworks** and writing articles about things I've learned over the years on [my blog](https://jeehut.medium.com).

Since I went full time Indie in **beginning of 2022**, I'm also [streaming my Open Source work on 👾Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/Jeehut) and upload my recordings later [to ▶️YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtg6Ck7oYa_9k1oSTmFGNRw).

Feel free to join my streams [when I'm live](https://www.twitch.tv/Jeehut/schedule) and **ask me anything** about iOS or Swift development or even **send me your Swift code** for a live code review & refactoring. **[Follow me](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtg6Ck7oYa_9k1oSTmFGNRw) also on YouTube** to support me, I have some more interesting content planned for the future there!
