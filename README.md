## About Me

My name is **Cihat G√ºnd√ºz** (Cihat reads like "**Jeehut**"). üëã

I'm a **Spatial-first Indie Developer for Ô£ø Platforms** from üá©üá™ Germany and I do iOS development since 2011. I like to contribute to our awesome community by creating **Open Source Tools** ([BartyCrouch](https://github.com/FlineDev/BartyCrouch), [HandySwift](https://github.com/FlineDev/HandySwift), [ReviewKit](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReviewKit), etc.) or helping out in existing projects ([SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen), [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), etc.).

Since 2022 I write the [Swift Evolution Monthly](https://swiftevolution.substack.com/?ref=github.com) newsletter where I summarize the newest developments in the Swift language for thousands of free subscribers. Since 2023 I'm the organizer of the [WWDC Notes](https://wwdcnotes.com/?ref=github.com) community project.

I share my learnings regularly on üê¶ [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/Jeehut?ref=github.com), on üßµ [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jeehut?ref=github.com), and ü¶£ [Mastodon](https://iosdev.space/@Jeehut?ref=github.com). Follow me there for development tips & contact me to discuss anything.

Since I went full-time Indie in 2022, I released 5 apps (**rate them** to help me!):
