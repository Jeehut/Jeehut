### Hi there 👋

My name is **Cihat Gündüz** (Cihat read like "**Jeehut**"), I'm an **📱Indie iOS Developer** from 🇩🇪Germany.

I'm doing iOS development **since 2011** and because I've learned so much from the great developer community, I'm now giving something back by **contributing 🔨Open Source tools & frameworks** and writing articles about things I've learned over the years on [my blog](https://fline.dev).

Since I went full-time Indie at **beginning of 2022**, I'm also [streaming my Open Source work on 👾Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/Jeehut) and uploading my recordings later [to ▶️YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlineDev). My work as an Indie developer is focused on two topics: Developer Tools and Daily Life & Productivity. My first app [ReMafoX](https://remafox.app) is a developer tool that makes **translating apps in Xcode easier and more fun**.

Feel free to join my streams [when I'm live](https://www.twitch.tv/Jeehut/schedule) and **ask me anything** about iOS or Swift development or even **send me your Swift code** for a live code review & refactoring. **[Follow me](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlineDev) also on YouTube** to support me, I have some more interesting content planned there for the future there!
